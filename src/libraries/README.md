# Libraries

This directory stores our custom libraries.

## Constants

Constants are self-explantory.

## Services

Services provide data from external sources that isn't stored using Klasa's data storage systems.

### Examples

- Data from a REST API
- Data from a Webhook
- Data from an IPC socket
- Data from another process' output (e.g. StarboundService)

## Structures

Structures are basically abstract/base classes.

## Templates

Templates are embed templates.

For instance, the `StarboundTemplate` adds the starbound logo and makes the sidebar Starbound-purple and so on.

## Types

Types are for miscellaneous TypeScript types/interfaces that don't really belong anywhere else.

## Utilities

Utilities are just that, various miscellaneous utilities.
