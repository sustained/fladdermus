# Fladdermus

Fladdermus is my personal Discord bot. She's written in TypeScript, using Klasa which is built on top of discord.js.

## Introduction

The first few versions mostly related to language learning as that was my main interest at the times, so she could do things like:

- exercises relating to evaluating one's proficiency in a language
- conjugating verbs etc.
- looking up word in dictionaries, on Wiktionary etc.
- and so on

### Why "Fladdermus"?

Fladdermus is the Swedish word for bat and Swedish is my [L2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_language). :bat:

I don't particularly like bats (except Fladdermus) but it's just a fun word.

It roughly translates as "flapping mouse". I know, right?

### Why version 4?

I'm learning [Klasa](https://klasa.js.org/#/) to replace my old friend Commando and I decided to relearn [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) simultaneously, so... I needed a project.

### Where are versions 1 through 3?

Those repositories are private.

## Documentation

There are READMEs in every directory, which will give you a brief overview of what that directory contains.

The code will also be at least somewhat reasonably well-commented, so feel free to read the source.

## Installation

```
cp .env.example .env # Don't forget to add your token etc. to .env.
npm install && npm build && npm run
```
